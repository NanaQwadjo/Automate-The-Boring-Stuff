# Automate the Boring Stuff
>I created a bunch of solutions for Automate The Boring Stuff that come with extra programs to help make it easier for you to get through the book. Automate The Boring Stuff With Python is written by Al Sweigart and is available online at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ or for purchase at https://nostarch.com/automatestuff or Amazon.

>The book is meant for people who are new to programming and want to learn how to write programs that can help with everyday tasks. Throughout the book, Sweigart gives you projects to practice with, and I completed almost all of them and put them online for you to see.

>It's worth noting that while my solutions work, there are probably better ways to achieve the similar results. I only used what I learned from the book to keep things familiar. Some of the chapters are outdated and the modules may have different syntax now, but I tried my best to point out any changes in the code. If you run into any issues with my code, let me know and I'll try to update it to accommodate new versions.

>I also added comments to my code to explain what's happening and why I did certain things. Subscribe to my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@jimfrvnklin) for more details on how the code works. I hope that putting everything together will make it easier for you.

>Lastly, I'm not a professional programmer, I've only taken one intro to programming in university and taught myself the rest. So I apologize if there are any mistakes in my code. I did my best to follow the PEP 8 guidelines when writing it, and I welcome any comments or suggestions you may have.

>Comments about the book:

>This was the first book I used when learning Python and I highly recommend it. I had little programming experience before with Excel VBA, MatLab and C++. Progamming languages are similar, but can also be very different for each one. Automate The Boring Stuff uses IDLE as the main source of writing code. While not needed, I HIGHLY suggest using an IDE, especially if you are new to programming. It will help you prevent making mistakes as well as trying to learn PEP 8 guidelines as you go. For this book I used Pycharm, my favorite IDE. However, you can search for something that fits your needs.
